        description:`Inspired by the world of Planet of the Apes, Brutus is a grizzled old chimpanzee who specializes in hunting humans.

        descriptionLong:`Inspired by the world of Planet of the Apes, Brutus is a grizzled old chimpanzee who specializes in hunting humans. He won't rest until mankind has either been eradicated or completely subjugated by his fellow apes. He is armed with a crudely-fashioned stone scythe, and carries a small stone dagger at his side. He wears a feathered deer skull headdress, goggles, a painted mask, tattered robes, a bone-covered vambrace, and a shoulder and shin guard made of scrap metal. He also carries two shrunken heads, a human skull, and a satchel marked with a tally of his human kills.

        description:`This doll was sculpted in polymer clay (Sculpey Living Doll) on a wire armature. A "bodysuit" was then sewn and stuffed with polyester wadding. The dress was hand-sewn cheesecloth, with a hand-painted design. The wheelchair's base is cardboard and wire. Raffia paper was woven and coated in wood glue for the backrest, the sides of the armrests, and the footrest. Twine was wrapped around the frame. The wheels are polymer clay, wire, and toothpicks.`,
        descriptionLong:`Until you're in my arms again, remember me.. ♪

        I made this art doll as a tribute to my beloved grandmother, who recently passed away, and to all the mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers who've touched our lives and taught us how to love and give. May we never take them for granted, and remember to appreciate them while they are with us. Re-watching Disney/Pixar's Coco reminded me that no one truly leaves us, for as long as we remember them, and pass on their stories.

        His head, hands, and feet were sculpted in "cold porcelain", which is actually just a microwaved mixture of cornstarch and glue. The clothes were handsewn. The hat was made by pressing frayed acrylic yarn, soaked in glue, onto a cardboard base. In effect, this was like making felt. I put a little feather in the hatband. He also has a gold-capped walking stick, made with an old paintbrush and epoxy putty.
        This very large art doll took three years to complete...sort of. My initial concept way back in 2017 was for a toad wizard, but I abandoned the entire project because I had problems making the limbs stay on the armature.
        
        Flash forward to 2020, and I have a better understanding of how to make my dolls, and was able to revitalize the project with some epoxy putty here and there. I changed the concept to a more Old-West-inspired look.`

        descriptionLong:`Finished up this polymer clay bust. I started making this on the first anniversary of the passing of Salvacion “Lola Bas” Calderon, whom the bust is based on. Lola Bas signed on to be our family nanny and cook when she was in her early 20s, and passed away in our home at the age of 86. “Lola” means grandmother, and that’s definitely who she was to me. Her cackling laugh that echoed through the house daily while she watched her corny Filipino game shows will always live in my memory (and in the videos and audio recordings I took the year before she passed).

        I think it goes without saying that this one is not for sale because it’s a personal work, but I may or may not be showcasing her at a local workshop (Brisbane) I’ve been planning. Hopefully I can confirm the details soon!

        descriptionLong:`"What are you doing FIREBENDING your TEA??" Made this art doll of Uncle Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender, after re-watching the entire series in three days. Anyone who knew me between 2005 and 2008 probably remembers how obsessed I was with this character. I'm glad to see that, recently on social media, he's been getting the love he deserves. Apart from being a powerful firebender and a skilled fighter, Iroh was wise, patient, and had a great sense of humor (plus a passion for tea). I tried re-creating the picnic he had to honor his son, Lu Ten, who died in battle. I don't need to explain to people who've watched Avatar how impactful Lu Ten's death was to Iroh's character development.
        
        I also made this doll to honor Mako Iwamatsu, Iroh's first voice actor. I remember how devastated I was when I learned that he had died, shortly before "The Tales of Ba Sing Se" aired. He was then lovingly emulated by Greg Baldwin. I attempted to combine Mako's face with Iroh's, to create a more realistic, but still stylized look.
        
        I learned the basics of weaving to make the picnic basket; that was a nightmare. I photoshopped a screenshot of the Lu Ten portrait and printed it out. The head, feet, and hands are made of polymer clay on a wire armature. The hair is mohair (Angora goat hair). The outfit was made in two layers, but it completely slipped my mind to take pictures of him just wearing the inner layer.`

        She's the usual hand-sculpted polymer clay on a wire armature with mohair hair and handsewn clothes. She also has a leather belt with pouches, and a sculpted buckle, radio (or is it a cantina??), and keys. The hat and goggles were by FAR the most challenging thing. The hat is polymer clay covered with fabric, the goggle arms are clay over wire, and the lenses are furniture feet. The furniture feet DO magnify the eyes, but it's really only visible when in person (doesn't show up in pics because the silicone is too foggy). So I did a bit of Photoshop cheating in the one photo of this series where she has her glasses on; I enhanced the eyes slightly.
        
        She ain't perfect but she fits in well with my other figures (like Premium Elite Series Rey)`
