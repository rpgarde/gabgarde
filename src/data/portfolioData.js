        title:"Fletcher St. Pierre, The Cane Toad",
        image:"fletcher.jpg",
        description:`Inspired by the Toad in Rango, and Mr. Toad from The Wind in the Willows. His head, hands, and feet were sculpted in "cold porcelain", which is actually just a microwaved mixture of cornstarch and glue. The clothes were handsewn. The hat was made by pressing frayed acrylic yarn, soaked in glue, onto a cardboard base. In effect, this was like making felt. I put a little feather in the hatband. He also has a gold-capped walking stick, made with an old paintbrush and epoxy putty.`
